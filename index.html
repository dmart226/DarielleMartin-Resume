        <p class="lead mb-4"> Families stand around eating tacos and chattering in Spanish, mouths full, rarely taking time to chew. The horn of an elote man selling raspados sounds. A se√±ora sells helados y paletas. Loud Spanish music blasts from buildings until three in the morning. This is Langdon Street, the place where my struggle of being black began.
Click clack.
It was the reassuring sound that my twists, held together by barrettes and clack balls, made every time I moved. However, when I started third grade and realized I was the only black girl in my graduating class of 2012, those feelings of pride and contentment quickly turned into resentment. Typically, the ability to turn heads usually indicates beauty or impressiveness, right? That didn‚Äôt apply to me. On picture day, they would spray and dampen everyone‚Äôs hair just before sitting down, but that only made my hair matted up, resembling a bird‚Äôs nest.  I questioned why my skin was dark, and why my hair was curly and thick instead of straight or wavy. Day after day, I left school feeling confused about who I was.
It wasn‚Äôt just my hair. I didn‚Äôt speak Spanish either. On Langdon Street, Spanish was necessary to thrive. I couldn‚Äôt engage in conversations about the latest Plazo Sesamo episode. The jokes told by my friends and excitement over pan dulce mystified me. School assemblies were held in Spanish, and as the child of a single mother, I spent everyday with babysitters who didn't speak English. I felt unwanted, misunderstood mostly because no one took the time to get to know me.
I wanted to hold on to the false hope that people would accept me for who I was, consumed by the fear of morphing into someone I wasn't. I didn't want to be separated from those clack balls, the heritage that circled through my blood, but despite my fears learning Spanish was unavoidable. I knocked on my neighbor‚Äôs door pleading for her to teach me, and she did. We practiced every day after school, and soon enough, I began having conversations with other children in Spanish. When the new kids arrived from Mexico, I was the first to befriend them, and each conversation enhanced my ability to communicate. Soon, the language stopped being a barrier for me and ironically became a gateway that enabled  me to learn more about myself and become more confident. But there were still the comments that reminded me that I was different, I was black ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad slavery is over because I would hate to not be your friend.‚Äù Those simple words haunted my childhood for years, because they had left the lips of my best friend.
<br><br>Just when I thought I had become apart of a community, I was pushed back out starting from square one. Discovering my true self was a matter of trial and error. Red Cross Club? Too much blood. Modern Music Club? I only listen to Ed Sheeran. I wanted an activity with opportunities to grow and have impact on anyone who felt like an outcast meanwhile creating an environment that was accepting of differences. Subsequently, I decided to try Yearbook, in the hopes that it would give me a platform to implement diversity into a piece of work to be cherished for years to come. 
I  interviewed and was selected, and became Copy Editor my first year. All the control of what should and could be said was up to me. Each page including a quote or a photo from individuals who wouldn‚Äôt typically be seen. I strived to create a Yearbook which reflects the past year and its students from all grades, races, and backgrounds. Everyone has a voice, a story, I want the thousands of students who read the book to see that. I refused to be silenced and an outcast in high school, determined to help those underrepresented.In the midst of collecting responses from multitudes of students collectively contributing to last years theme of ‚Äú power‚Äù I truly encountered diversity at its finest. Every students story caused me realize my skin color or hair doesn‚Äôt define me, it empowers me. 


      <br><br>  Click clack.
This time, it is the sound of my five year old sister‚Äôs hair. There is a twelve year difference, yet much hasn't changed. She is the only black child in her class, she still gets the stares and curiosity prompted by the accessories that hold her hair together, that keep her connected to her roots. However, I chose to teach her Spanish in order to turn my struggle into her advantage. As she goes on her similar journey of finding herself I want her to have the knowledge and confidence I didn‚Äôt. 
I want to be a prime example that little black girls wearing their barrettes and clack balls are more than what meets the eye. Its okay for people to stare it isn‚Äôt intended to make us feel bad, they are simply in awe.<br><br>
